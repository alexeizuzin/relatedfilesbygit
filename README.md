# relatedfilesbygit README

Search related files by git history for opened document. Need to set repository path. Mac os: shift+cmd+j, Win: ctrl+alt+j

Important: it sets opened folder as repository folder.

Hi! Extension makes:
- git log <filename>
- git show (every commit)
- collect statistics of commonly used files

**Enjoy!**
